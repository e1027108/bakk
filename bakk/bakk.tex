This bachelor thesis explains the concept of the abstract argumentation framework, its properties as well as its extensions. It further analyzes the relations between different types of extensions.\hl
The main part of the thesis is the modelling of the explained concepts as code and the developement of a JAVA application which is capable of creating custom argumentation frameworks, their visualisation as graphs and the computation of extensions. The application is created in a way such that students can study argumentation frameworks in an easily digestable way including step-by-step explanations of how the extensions are computed accompanied by colored highlighting of important aspects of the frameworks' graphs.\\ %TODO work in progress

\chapter{Definitions}

To work with argumentation frameworks, first we must define their properties. This section will lay out the basic structure of argumentation frameworks as well as provide extension types for further analysis.\hl

\textbf{Definition 1.} An \emph{argumentation framework} $F$ is a pair $(A,R)$, where $A$ is a set of arguments and $R$ is a set of attack relations.\dl

\textbf{Definition 2.} \emph{Attack relations} $R\subseteq A\times A$ represent attacks. The pair $(a,b)$, where $a,b\in A$ means $a$ \emph{attacks} $b$.\dl

\textbf{Example 1.} Imagine we have 3 arguments $a_1$, $a_2$, and $b$.\hl
			\begin{tabular}{p{0.5cm}p{0.5cm}l}
			& $a_1$ & = ''Blue is the most beautiful of all colors.''\\
			& $b$ & = ''No, black is much more beautiful!''\\
			& $a_2$ & = ''That's wrong, black isn't even a color.''
			\end{tabular}\hl
These arguments obviously contain 2 attacks. Argument $b$ attacks argument $a_1$ and in turn argument $a_2$ attacks argument $b$.\hl
This results in the framework $F=(A,R)$, where $A=\{a_1,a_2,b\}$ and $R=\{(b,a_1),(a_2,b)\}$.\dl
As writing an argument framework in sets might become hard to read with increasing set sizes, it is also possible to write every framework as a graph $(V,E)$, where $V=A$ and $E=R$. The graph in our example looks like this:\dl

	\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\textbf{Remark 1.} Let $S$ be a set of arguments. If $a\in S$ and there is an attack $(a,b)\in R$ we say $S$ \emph{attacks} $b$.\dl

Depending on their properties, arguments can be grouped into \emph{extensions}.\dl

\textbf{Definition 3.} Let $S$ be a set of arguments. It is \emph{conflict-free}, if $\forall a \forall b\ a,b\in S, (a,b)\notin R$.\\
The set of all conflict-free sets of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $cf(F)$.\dl

\textbf{Example 2.} (Continuation of Example 1) As no argument attacks itself, $\{a_1\}$, $\{a_2\}$ and $\{b\}$ each are conflict-free. $\{a_1,a_2\}$ is also a conflict-free set, since there exists no attack relation containing $a_1$ and $a_2$. The empty set is always conflict-free.\\
Since there is an attack relation between $b$ and each of the other arguments, there are no other conflict-free sets.\hl
It follows that $cf(F)=\{\emptyset,\{a_1\},\{a_2\},\{b\},\{a_1,a_2\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 4.} An argument $a$ is \emph{defended} by a set $S$, if for every attack $(b,a)\in R$ there is an attack $(c,b)$, where $c\in S$. If this is the case $S$ \emph{defends} $a$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 5.} Let $S$ be a conflict-free set. It is called an \emph{admissible extension} if it defends each $a\in S$.\\
The set of all admissible extensions of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $adm(F)$.\dl

\textbf{Example 3.} (Continuation of Example 2) Of the conflict-free sets only $\{a_2\}$ and \(\emptyset\) don't get attacked. They are admissible. $\{a_1,a_2\}$ gets attacked via the attack relation $(b,a_1)$, but $a_1$ gets defended through $(a_2,b)$, making it also admissible.\\
$\{b\}$ and $\{a_1\}$ are not admissible since they don't defend their arguments.\hl
It follows that $adm(F)=\{\emptyset,\{a_1,a_2\},\{a_2\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 6.} Let $S$ be an admissible extension. It is called a \emph{preferred extension} if for each $S'\subseteq A$, that is an admissible extension, $S\not\subset S'$.\\
The set of all preferred extensions of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $pr(F)$.\dl

\textbf{Example 4.} (Continuation of Example 3) Since $\emptyset\subset\{a_2\}$, \(\emptyset\) is not a preferred extension. $\{a_2\}\subset\{a_1,a_2\}$, therefore $\{a_2\}$ is not a preferred extension.\\
Since all other admissible extensions are proper subsets of $\{a_1,a_2\}$, it is a preferred extension.\hl
It follows that $prf(F)=\{\{a_1,a_2\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 7.} Let $S$ be a conflict-free set. It is called a \emph{stable extension} if for each $a\not\in S$ there is exists an attack $(b,a)\in R$ where $b\in S$.\\
The set of all stable extensions of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $st(F)$.\dl

\textbf{Example 5.} (Continuation of Example 2) The conflict-free sets $\emptyset$ and $\{a_1\}$ don't attack any of the other arguments, $\{a_2\}$ only attacks $\{b\}$, missing an attack on $\{a_1\}$. $\{b\}$ misses an attack on $\{a_2\}$. They are not stable extensions.\\
$\{a_1,a_2\}$ attacks all other arguments in $\{b\}$ (attack relation $(a_2,b)$) and therefore is a stable extension.\hl
It follows that $st(F)=\{\{a_1,a_2\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 8.} Let $S$ be an admissible extension. It is called a \emph{complete extension} if for each $a\not\in S$, $S\cup \{a\}$ is not an admissible extension.\\
The set of all complete extensions of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $co(F)$.\dl

\textbf{Example 6.} (Continuation of Example 3) The admissible extension $\emptyset$ is not a complete extension because it defends $a_2$ which it doesn't contain. $\{a_2\}$ defends $a_1$ and is therefore also not a complete extension.\\
$\{a_1,a_2\}$ attacks $b$ and as there are no other arguments which could be defended it is a complete extension.\hl
It follows that $co(F)=\{\{a_1,a_2\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Definition 9.} The (unique) \emph{grounded extension} is defined by $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n{S_i}$, where $\{S_1,...,S_n\}$ is the set of all complete extensions.\\
The grounded extension of an argumentation framework $F$ is denoted $gr(F)$\dl

\textbf{Example 7.} (Continuation of Example 6) Since there is only one complete extension $\{a_1,a_2\}$, it also is the grounded extension $gr(F)$.\dl

\chapter{Observations}

As we have seen in the previous section, often there may be overlaps between the different extension types. In this section we will discuss those relations between extension types. Additionally we will explore their unique features.\dl

As per the definitions of the extension there are the following relations:
\begin{align} %find structure that instead centers
	adm(F)\subseteq cf(F)\\
	st(F)\subseteq cf(F)\\
	prf(F)\subseteq adm(F)\\
	co(F)\subseteq adm(F)\\
\end{align}\dl

\textbf{Lemma 1.} %TODO provide proof
Each stable extension is a preferred extension, but not every preferred extension is a stable extension.\\
\begin{align}
	st(F)\subseteq prf(F)\\
	prf(F)\not\subseteq st(F)
\end{align}
Therefore each stable extension also is an admissible extension.\dl

\textbf{Example 7.} Let $F$ be an argumentation framework $(A,R)$ such that $A={a,b,c}$ and $R={(b,a),(b,c),(a,a),(c,b)}$.

	\begin{figure}[!htb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphs/ex2.pdf}
		\caption{Example for the difference between stable and preferred extensions}
	\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

It can be computed that $cf(F)=adm(F)=\{\{b\},\{c\}\}$. So we only have to consider two extensions for further computations.\hl
As can be seen, $\{b\}$ is the only conflict-free set that attacks all other arguments. Therefore $st(F)=\{\{b\}\}$.\hl
We know that $\{b\}$ has to be a preferred extension, because of Lemma 1. $\{c\}$ attacks only it's attacker $b$, but not $a$. Therefore it is preferred and $prf(F)=\{\{b\},\{c\}\}$.\dl

\textbf{Lemma 2.} %check for something better
The grounded extension is always admissible. %and, something?
\begin{align}
	gr(F)\subseteq adm(F)
\end{align}

%others, TODO split within text

\begin{align}
	co(F)\not\subseteq prf(F)\\
	prf(F)\not\subseteq co(F)\\
	\exists F\ prf(F)\cap co(F) \not = \emptyset\\
	\exists F\ st(F)\cap co(F) \not = \emptyset 
\end{align}

\chapter{Application}

\section{Introduction}
In this section the usage and implementation details of the aforementioned program illustrating the computation of the different extension types is provided. The application consists of two views: the input mask and the graph view.

\section{Input mask}
On starting the application the user is presented with an input mask. It consists of ten rows representing the arguments of an argumentation framework. The number of arguments is limited to ten because a higher number of arguments doesn't provide any further benefit to a user wanting to learn about the basics of argumentation frameworks.\\
Each row consists of a checkbox and two textfields.\hl
Each checkbox is labeled with the name of the argument the row represents. If a checkbox is selected the program will use the represented argument for further computations and visualisations.\hl
The first textfield of each row contains the optional description of the argument in question. The argument description is optional because it is only used in a cosmetic, non-functional way in the rest of the program.\hl
The second textfield of each row contains the names of the arguments the argument in question attacks. Argument names are case-insensitive and can be, but don't have to be, seperated either by ',' or spaces.\hl
The ``show graph'' button checks input in selected rows for problems. It detects attacks against non-existent arguments, while treating multiple attacks of an argument against another argument are ignored. It further provides error messages, so the user knows about issues. Note that unselected rows are ignored, even if there is a description or attacks already defined. This enables the user to quickly add or remove arguments for comparison in the next window.\hl
To make using the application easier, every item seen on screen shows a tooltip explaining the purpose of that element.

		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/input.png}

	\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

%TODO update figure name?
Figure 4.1 shows the input mask with input representing the argumentation framework $F=(A,R)$ with $A=\{a,b,c,d\}$ and $R=\{(a,b),(b,c),(c,a),(d,b)\}$.

\section{Graph view}
Once an argument framework is created, ``show graph'' clicked and no problems detected the graph view is shown.

\FloatBarrier
	\begin{figure}[!htb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/demo.png}
		\caption{Graph view resulting from Figure 4.1}
	\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Upon loading the graph view the user can see the graph representing the argument framework defined in the input mask to the left. Every argument is represented by a node labelled with that arguments name.\hl
The user then has the option to choose to compute one of six extension types:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item conflict-free set
	\item admissible extension
	\item preferred extension
	\item stable extension
	\item complete extension
	\item grounded extension
\end{itemize}

If the checkbox to ``use previously computed sets for further computations'' is selected, each computation takes into account the results of preceding computations, if applicable. If this option is not selected the program will compute every extension type needed, prior to computing the chosen extension.\hl
Each computation triggers the text area to the right to display explanations of how the computed extensions came to pass. This explanation can either be shown step-by-step, all at once or be skipped and only the results be shown. Figure 4.3 shows an example of the explanation area after all steps were shown for the graph in Figure 4.2.

	\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

To further illustrate the explanations shown the application recolors the graph for each step, using three easily distinguishable colors:\hl
Green is used for arguments included in the considered set and their relevant attacks needed to qualify for an extension type.\\
Red is used for conflicting arguments and attacks preventing a set of arguments from qualifying for an extension type.\\
Blue is used for arguments missing from a set for it to qualify for an extension type.
